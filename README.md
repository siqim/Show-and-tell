# Show and tell
This repo was a course project for CS 598DL Fall 2018 in UIUC. It is a PyTorch implementation of the paper [Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4555). Please refer to [Project Slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Nk10SBrSf9nuWQ9VGtgYirsE29n1UbGD) for more details. The model trained with our code can perform better than Google's original implementation, see [MSCOCO Leaderboard](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/3221#results) for team `siqimiao`, and team `OriolVinyals` is the Google's implementation.
