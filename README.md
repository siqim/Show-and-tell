# Show and tell
This repo was a course project for CS 598DL Fall 2018 in UIUC. It is a PyTorch implementation of the paper [Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4555). Please refer to [Project Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sQfuwHV2XYZ0sAQ1JLnmLRsVnGtZroQc/view?usp=sharing) for more details. The model trained with our code (~130 hrs training!) can perform better than Google's original implementation. See [MSCOCO Leaderboard](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/3221#results) for detailed performance with team `siqimiao`, and team `OriolVinyals` is the Google's implementation.
